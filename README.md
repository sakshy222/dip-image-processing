📸 Digital Image Processing using Python & OpenCV

This repository contains implementations of important Digital Image Processing (DIP) techniques using Python, OpenCV, and NumPy.
All experiments were implemented and tested using Google Colab.

🚀 Tech Stack

Python

OpenCV

NumPy

Google Colab

🧪 Experiments Implemented
1️⃣ Image Arithmetic Operations

Addition of two images

Subtraction of one image from another

Mean value of image

Brightness adjustment using mean

2️⃣ Image Enhancement

Image Negative

Binary Thresholding

Thresholding with Background

Contrast Stretching

3️⃣ Histogram Processing

Histogram Equalization

Contrast improvement of grayscale images

4️⃣ Image Blending

Weighted sum of two images using cv2.addWeighted()

📂 How to Run

Open Google Colab

Upload the image files (e.g., apple.jpg, img1.jpg, img2.jpg)

Run the Python code cells

Output images will be displayed and can be downloaded

📷 Sample Outputs

The repository contains generated output images such as:

Negative images

Thresholded images

Contrast-stretched images

Histogram equalized images

🎯 Purpose of the Project

This project was created as part of a Digital Image Processing laboratory to understand how image enhancement and arithmetic operations improve image quality and visual information.
